# UI-UX-Experiment1

Hands-on UI/UX Experiments

a. Explore the fundamentals of UI and UX
b. Differentiate between UI and UX using real-world case studies.
c. Illustrate the relationship between UI and UX in design.
d. Demonstrate various UI/UX design tools in detail.

## Aim:

To study the fundamentals of UI and UX, differentiate between UI and UX using real-world examples, understand their relationship in the design process, and explore commonly used UI/UX design tools.
Additionally, to conduct a simple comparative experiment demonstrating the impact of UI and UX improvements on usability metrics.

## Algorithm:

*Study the fundamentals of UI and UX.
*Understand the purpose and importance of UI and UX in product design.
*Identify the differences between UI and UX using real-world examples.
*Explain the relationship between UI and UX in the design workflow.
*Explore commonly used UI/UX tools such as Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, Axure, Miro, and Balsamiq.
*Create two design versions: Version A (Control) and Version B (Improved UI/UX).
*Conduct usability testing by assigning participants to complete the same task on each version.
*Record metrics such as task completion rate, time taken, errors, and SUS score.
*Compare the collected results between Version A and Version B.
*Analyze the impact of UI and UX improvements on usability.
*Conclude findings and document insights.

## Output:
*Fundamental concepts of UI and UX were documented.
*Differences between UI and UX were explained using real-world case studies.
*The relationship between UI and UX was clearly illustrated.
*Detailed descriptions of various UI/UX tools were provided.
*Usability testing output was generated comparing Version A and Version B.
*Results showed improvements in usability metrics for the redesigned version.

## Result:
*UI and UX serve different but complementary roles in design.
*UX improvements in flow and structure enhance user efficiency.
*UI enhancements in visual clarity improve user interaction and satisfaction.
*Version B performed better than Version A in completion rate, time, and SUS score.
*The experiment confirmed that strong UI and UX together create a better overall user experience.
